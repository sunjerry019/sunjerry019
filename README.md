## Hi there, servus! ðŸ‘‹

I am a Singaporean Physics / Quantum Science and Technology (QST) Masters' student at [LMU](https://www.en.uni-muenchen.de/)/[TUM](https://www.tum.de/en/) in Munich, Germany.

I am enthusiatic about exploring things from the ground up to understand how everything works together  
...and then building upon them.

Open to collaborations :)

If only there were more than 24 hours in a day....
